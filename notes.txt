Git and Github

"git bash" -> name for the terminal in Windows
git -> language for version control
bash -> flavor of operating system called Linux
Github -> storage space online

Problem: we want to store our code.
Specifically, we want to store different versions of our code.
    If we upload new code that's broken, we want to be able
    to revert to an older version of code ASAP.

Keep track of two separate versions of our code to start.
    Local version, on our machine.
    External version, located in Github.

When we make changes on the LOCAL version, we need to send them
to the EXTERNAL version when we're ready. 

git init 
    (initialize a local repository)
git status
    (lets me know what branch I'm on and what changes are
    committed or uncommitted)
